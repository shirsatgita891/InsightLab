Sunless tanning products, especially sprays, have gained popularity among a diverse range of consumers due to their ease of application, convenience, and ability to deliver a natural-looking tan without sun exposure. Additionally, the expansion of e-commerce platforms and rising disposable income, particularly in developed markets, have contributed to the market's upward trajectory. The market is also benefiting from continuous innovations in formulations that provide longer-lasting, streak-free tans and a more natural appearance, further driving consumer preference.
