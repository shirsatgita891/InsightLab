These include benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), urinary incontinence, spinal cord injuries, and others. Each of these applications presents a unique set of needs and challenges that are driving the demand for these devices. The market’s dynamic growth is largely attributed to evolving medical technologies, patient care trends, and increasing awareness about effective urinary management solutions.</p><h3>Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH)</h3><p>Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition among aging men, characterized by the enlargement of the prostate gland, which can obstruct the flow of urine. This leads to urinary retention, frequency, and incontinence, which often necessitate the use of intermittent catheters for efficient urinary drainage. Uncoated intermittent catheters are particularly beneficial for BPH patients as they provide a simple and non-invasive solution to manage the condition. These catheters are designed for temporary use, which suits BPH patients who may experience periodic flare-ups or complications related to urinary retention.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific market, the growing elderly population is a key driver for the increase in BPH cases, which in turn is boosting the demand for uncoated intermittent catheters. As healthcare providers shift toward more cost-effective and less invasive treatment options for BPH, the adoption of these catheters continues to rise. Additionally, the increasing awareness about BPH symptoms and treatments is encouraging more patients to seek proper medical attention, further contributing to market growth. The availability of uncoated intermittent catheters as part of a broader treatment plan is helping improve patient outcomes while reducing the risk of complications associated with urinary retention.</p><h3>Urinary Incontinence</h3><p>Urinary incontinence is a condition that affects both men and women, where individuals experience an involuntary loss of urine.
